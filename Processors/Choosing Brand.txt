    When choosing a processor, you have to figure out if you want fast but expensive gaming and otherwise single-core speeds 
(intel) or faster and cheaper multi-core speeds for multi tasking, editing, and generally low end builds to around $800 USD
(AMD). 

NOTES: All of AMD's models can be overclocked (common way to make to run a higher than preset speed), while only 
Intel's processor that end with a -K can be overclocked. Also, AMD  will be using the AM4 motherboard socket until at least 
2020, while Intel changes it's socket often, so AMD is better for upgradability.

    After choosing, if you chose AMD, the recommended models for price/performance are the 2200G for low end and the 2600 for 
mid class builds. If you chose Intel, get a 8600K or 9600K (whichever's cheapest) if you're going to overclock, or a 8400 
otherwise, at which point you may as well go for the AMD Ryzen 2600 anyway. Or if you're going to go for max performance, go 9900K, but it's expensive for it's speed.
